# RISC-V Edge AI Workshop - My Learning Journey

This repository is a documentation of my work from the RISC-V Edge AI Workshop conducted by VLSI System Design.

---
Throughout this program, I progressed through:

- **Day 1:** Introduction to the need for running ML/DL workloads on compact and power-efficient chips. Set up FreedomStudio, executed the SiFive “Welcome” program, reviewed documentation for the VSDQuadron PRO board, and prepared all required files for the workshop environment.
- **Day 2:** Studied foundational ML models, beginning with Linear Regression followed by Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 and 3). Visualized model behavior using Python and Desmos for the 'studentscores.csv' dataset. Trained Linear and polynomial Regression models on the '50_Startups.csv' dataset as well.
- **Day 3:** Implemented the first machine learning model (Linear Regression) on a RISC-V platform using Freedom Studio. The model was trained on the '50_Startups.csv' dataset and used to predict Profit based on R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend. Additionally, began working on classification models by implementing Logistic Regression on the 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' dataset and visualized the working of Logistic Regression using Python.
- **Day 4:** Disadvantage of Logistic Regression and then moved forward towards implementing KNN (k-nearest neighbors) model and implemented the model on 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' dataset
- **Day 5:** 
- **Day 6:** 
- **Day 7:**
