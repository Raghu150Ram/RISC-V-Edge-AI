# RISC-V Edge AI Workshop - My Learning Journey

This repository is a documentation  of my work from the RISC-V Edge Ai Workshop conducted by VLSI System Design.

---
Over the two days, i progressed through:

- **Day 1:** Introduction to the need for running ML/DL workloads on compact and power-efficient chips. Set up FreedomStudio, executed the SiFive “Welcome” program, reviewed documentation for the VSDQuadron PRO board, and prepared all required files for the workshop environment.
- **Day 2:** Studied foundational ML models, beginning with Linear Regression followed by Polynomial Regression (degrees 2 and 3). Visualized model behavior using Python and Desmos for the 'studentscores.csv' dataset. Trained Linear and polynomial Regression models on the '50_Startups.csv' dataset as well.
